This is the repo where the goal was to make a simple ecommerce store. It has most of the standard feature in any store like categories, shopping carts, products, and product reviews. I did not implement a charging service like Stripe as I do not actualy plan on using this site to sell products. This was more for the learning expereince in building out a web application with a React frontend, ASP Core Dotnet backend and utilizing LocalStack's S3 bucket to store the product photos.
