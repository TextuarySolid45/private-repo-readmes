![Alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TextuarySolid45/private-repo-readmes/main/images/tour-of-players.png)

I created this project as it is a common tutorial project for the Angular framework. It is suppose to be tour of hero but I did not like that so I changed it to tour of players. Baseball Players that is for the SF Giants.
