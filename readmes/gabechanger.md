GabeChanger is a mobile app for IOS that saves my baseball stats for my Sunday League baseball games. I uses React-Native for the front end and AWS Amplify for the backend. It is currently no publicly available as I do not want to pay the $100 Apple Developer fee but once I have a few apps to publish, I will commit that money.
